			The Tag control formats its content as an XML tag. The control is a simple
			example of what’s effectively a parameterized HTML macro that includes both content 
			(opening and closing brackets) and styling (a fixed-width font).

			The <Tag>script</Tag> defines the Tag control’s own contents to be
			as the contents of the <Tag>span</Tag>
			tag.

			The behavior of the Tag control is simple enough that it could be replicated purely
			in CSS 3 by making use of the “content” attribute. The content attribute allows one
			to specify text that should appear before and after a matching HTML element.
			The QuickUI approach is more flexible in that it allows arbitrary elements to be
			placed before and after the control’s content.
