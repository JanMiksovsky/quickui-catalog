   * a surrounding Tabs is trying to determine the height of a Tab that
   * contains a paragraph (or, presumably, other elements) that have top and
   * bottom margins. In that case, the Tab's outerHeight() will fail to
   * include the paragraph's margins, with the result that the Tabs can
   * incorrectly calculate the height it needs to be. Forcing some padding
   * seems to work around this problem.
