            A text input area with a dropdown set of choices. The user can make selections from the list
            to populate input area, or they can type arbitrary text strings which don't necessarily
            appear in the list.

        <notes>
            The HTML5 specification calls for a <Tag>datagrid</Tag> element which can be used to
            create combo boxes, but even once that is broadly supported, the ComboBox class
            still has a role to play as a base class for custom combo boxes.
