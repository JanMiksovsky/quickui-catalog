            Layout for a main content area with panels on the top and/or bottom
            <i>of an unknown size</i> (i.e., which size to their content), and
            where the main content area should take the remaining space.

		    <p>
            There are many strategies for laying out top/bottom panels, but these
            all have various constraints, e.g., requiring that the top/bottom panels
            have a known, fixed height.

		    <p>
		    The VerticalPanels control is similar to the vertical uses of
		    the XAML (Silverlight) DockPanel control. The layout engine which
		    VerticalPanels relies on uses JavaScript to recalculate the height
		    of the panels when the control is resized.
