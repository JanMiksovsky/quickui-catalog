		<summary>
			The GalleryPage control is the basic template for all controls
			in the QuickUI gallery. It defines the main content area of the
			type of page you are looking at right now.
		</summary>
		<demo>
			This page is its own demo of the control’s behavior! The Sample
			Usage section shows the entire source code of the elements
			unique to the specific page you’re looking at now. All pages
			on this site are constructed similarly.
		</demo>
		<notes>
			This control is a good example of a page template with numerous
			slots which can be filled in by setting properties on the
			control. For the control properties that point to source code,
			the GalleryPage control delegates responsibility for showing the
			source code to the separate SourceCode control. GalleryPage is a
			subclass of another control called SitePage (which adds the
			site’s standard top and left navigation) and ultimately from
			the <GalleryLink>Page</GalleryLink> base class.
