<!--
Wraps an anchor tag.

Unlike a stock anchor tag, this will show a hand cursor even when the href
is empty, as is often the case with a link whose behavior is determined by
a click event handler.

This can also serve as a useful base class for custom link classes.

<Control className="Link" tag="a">

<style>
{
    cursor: pointer;
}
</style>

<script>
Link.prototype.extend({
    href: Control.chain( "prop/href" ),
    target: Control.chain( "prop/target" )
});
</script>

</Control>
