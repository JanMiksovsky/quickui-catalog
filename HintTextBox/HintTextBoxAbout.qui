            The standard approach to hint text is to display the hint as text in
            the text box itself, then remove it when the text box receives the focus.
            The problem is that there are occasions when the hint should still be
            visible after the control receives the focus. First, a user tabbing
            into a field may still want to have the hint visible until they begin
            typing. Second, there are times when it’s desirable to place the default
            focus for a page into a text box with a hint. Third, if the user erases
            what they have typed, it’s helpful to show the hint again.
