###
A list of links on a mobile device.

Note, while the items in the list will appear (and should behave) like links,
they don't actually have to be implemented links (e.g., as anchor tags or Link
controls.)

This currently uses an iOS visual style.
TODO: Detect Android and use appropriate Android style.
