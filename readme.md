This is the source for the QuickUI Catalog.

The /quickui.catalog folder contains the source for the catalog controls.
That folder is built with the QuickUI qb tool to create quickui.catalog.js and
.css. Those files are made available at http://quickui.org/release via the
script in the deploy folder.

The /docs folder contains the documentation for the catalog controls,
including the source for any demos and samples. The documentation gets posted
to http://quickui.org/catalog. Before posting, the "mkdocs" script should be
run to generate control member documentation from the .qui sources.
