This is the source for the QuickUI Catalog.

The /quickui.catalog folder contains the source for the catalog controls.
That folder is built with the QuickUI qb tool to create quickui.catalog.js and
.css. Those files are made available at http://quickui.org/release.

The /docs folder contains the documentation for the catalog controls,
including the source for any demos and samples. The documentation gets posted
to http://quickui.org/catalog.
